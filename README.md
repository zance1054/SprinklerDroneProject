# Sprinkler Drone Project
## CECS 491A and 491B Senior Project

## The Project
-------------------------------------------

An artificial intelligence implementation in drone technology to create an autonomous lawn care and maintenance assistant system to replace underground sprinkler systems for a more conservative and modernized system that saves the user money, power, and water.

## Features
--------------------------------------------

    - Autonomous Drone that manages and maintains assigned lawns

    - Innovative computer vision for working specifically in low-light conditions

    - Weather API integration for real time schedule adjustment and determining water requirements for a healthy lawn

    - A mobile application for viewing water and power consumption while also serving as an emergency manual override controller and notification center for real time lawn information.

    - A web application that informs the user of relative metrics concerning their savings over time due to the implementation of the autonomous lawn care system.
